# SimConnect Config Tool

This little tool allows Flight Simulator X users to easily edit and setup their SimConnect configuration, e.g. in order to enable or disable remote applications such as [FSXGET](http://www.juergentreml.de/fsxget) to connect to Flight Simulator X.

The tool has been written as a result of the needs of some [FSXGET](http://www.juergentreml.de/fsxget) users but can be used to configure SimConnect in general (not only for use with [FSXGET](http://www.juergentreml.de/fsxget)). For any support or comment you have, use the [original homepage](http://www.juergentreml.de/simconnectconfigtool) of the tool (which is still not too crowded with information ;-) ) <strike>or the discussion page here on CodePlex</strike>. You may also want to have a look at the [contact information page on the FSXGET website](https://github.com/jtreml/fsxget/wiki/Contact-&-Support).

A HowTo article on [setting up FSXGET for remote access to FSX on another computer](https://github.com/jtreml/fsxget/wiki/HowTo---SimConnect-Network-Configuration) using this tool can be found here.
